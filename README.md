This project creates an interactive Rothko-inspired painting using HTML and CSS. The design simulates the abstract style of Mark Rothko’s works, emphasizing vibrant color blocks and soft, blurred edges. The project introduces interactivity to the artwork, making it visually dynamic and engaging for users.

Key Features
Frame and Canvas:

The frame acts as a border, giving the painting a polished gallery-like presentation.
The canvas serves as the background for the color blocks, featuring a subtle blur effect that softens the visuals.
Color Blocks:

Three abstract rectangles (.one, .two, .three) are styled with different colors, dimensions, and slight rotations to reflect the uneven and organic nature of Rothko’s work.
Each rectangle is positioned centrally on the canvas, maintaining balance and symmetry.
Interactive Animations:

Hover Effects:
Hovering over the canvas sharpens the blurred effect and slightly changes the background color for better focus.
Each rectangle reacts to hover with smooth scaling, rotation correction, and an enhanced glow effect, making the elements feel alive.
Frame Interaction:
The frame scales up slightly when hovered, creating a zoom-in effect to draw attention.
Transitions:

Smooth transitions are implemented for all interactive elements, ensuring a polished and fluid user experience.
Aesthetic Design:

The blurred edges, soft shadows, and slightly irregular rotations of the rectangles create an abstract and artistic aesthetic.
The color palette consists of warm, earthy tones like ochre, deep red, and maroon, inspired by Rothko's characteristic style.
